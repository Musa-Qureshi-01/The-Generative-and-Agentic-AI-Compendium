## 📌 Introduction

This repository is a **personal learning compendium** that documents my journey into  
**Generative AI, Agentic AI systems, and LLM-based application engineering**.

Everything in this repository — **notes, code experiments, projects, and resources** — has been **created by me as part of my learning process**.  
Instead of spreading experiments across multiple repositories, I intentionally chose to **consolidate my entire learning journey into a single evolving repository**.

This repo reflects:
- How I **learn concepts**
- How I **experiment with ideas**
- How I **build systems**
- How my understanding **evolves over time**

## 🧭 What This Repository Represents

- 📘 Conceptual notes written while learning  
- 💻 Code experiments to validate ideas  
- 🧪 Practice projects (beginner → advanced)  
- 🔍 Iterations, failures, refinements, and improvements  
- 🧠 A growing understanding of modern AI system design  

This is not a polished framework — it is a **learning record**.
